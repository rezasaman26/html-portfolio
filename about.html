<h1>About me</h1>
<P>The proverb refers to how the blacksmith heats the iron in order to make it malleable. When it cools, the blacksmith loses the ability to shape it into the desired shape. Our lives are like iron; when an opportunity arises, we must be prepared to seize it in order to change our lives. There is no point in moping about missed opportunities after time has passed. Wise men remain alert and recognise opportunities as they arise. The foolish, on the other hand, sit back and watch as opportunities pass them by. Our unwillingness to take risks can frequently leave us empty-handed.The proverb refers to how the blacksmith heats the iron in order to make it malleable.
